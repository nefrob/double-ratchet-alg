# Double Ratchet Algorithm in Python

Implements Double Ratchet Algorithm per Signal [secifications](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/).

### Usage

Come back later! Currently in early development.

### Dependencies

Built using Python 3.8.2.  

```pip3 install cryptography```


### Tasks:

- ~~Find crypto lib~~
- ~~Implement Signal spec double ratchet crypto functions~~
- ~~Add minor error checking to crypto~~
- ~~Handle missing/skipped messages~~
- ~~Test basic cross user ratchet steps~~
- Refactor and simplify ratchet/crypto code
- Header encryption
- Add debug logging
- Setup session/users/state + cleanup interface

Extra options:

- Add backdoor?
- Maybe integrate with X3HD
